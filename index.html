                The Pillar Men are from a race of ancient, humanoid, super human beings. These beings are now nearly extinct, They are highly intelligent, extremely strong, and able to
                manipulate their bodies to a very fine degree; however, they are vulnerable to the rays of the Sun and to the Ripple.

              <p class="JOJO-Carousel-descri">
                Their physiology is very different from humans, though outwardly they appear very similar. The only visible feature that can 
                differentiate them from humans is the horns on their forehead. for them, displaying their horns is a sign of honor. 
                Moreover, these beings are inherently powerful, have athletic physiques 
                exclusively, and have long life spans. Their near immortality causes them to produce only very few children, 
                as there is little need, and sleep for millennia instead of hours, staying awake for comparable periods.</p>

                The four remaining representatives of this species in the world are Kars, Esidisi, Wamuu, and Santana, in descending 
                order of hierarchy, now called "Pillar Men" since they were discovered sleeping inside stone pillars. Led by Kars, 
                this group awakens in 1938 to continue seeking out the Red Stone of Aja, which, combined with their technology of 
                the Stone Mask, will transform them into "ultimate beings" immune even to the Sun.</p>
